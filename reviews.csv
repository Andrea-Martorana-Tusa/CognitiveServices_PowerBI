We were fortunate that he was there both when we arrived and left and told us about the flat and suggested a great place to park our car. The location of the apartment, close to one of the “sees” was wonderful and it was convenient for both public transport (about 10 mins to the Metro )and walking to the city centre( about 30 mins). It also had all the amenities to make our stay perfect …… and he even organised snow one day ( we are Australian ) and brilliant sunshine the next ! JB and Maree"

As a piece of advice, get familiar with the Sharebox service for receiving your keys before your trip, as you need to have the app, or to be able to send text messages (in case your roaming doesn't work, it will be an issue). Rebecca is very helpful in the communication to figure things out, but it would have saved me a lot of stress, if I knew beforehand what I had to use, and also how to use. It's relatively easy though :)"
